# super-hosts
Super hosts file amalgamated from several sources to suit the needs of my network. Contains over 68,000 unique entries. The bulk of the hosts come from Steven Black's https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts, which was also used to generate this host file. I put it here so that my DD-WRT enabled router can pull the hosts file on boot.
